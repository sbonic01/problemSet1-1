    <h3>A Trip to the Southwest</h3>
    <p>In May of 2023, I took a very exciting trip to the American Southwest. Specifically, my boyfriend and I spent a day in Las Vegas and then embarked on an 8-day roadtrip where we visited Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, Horseshoe Bend, Lake Powell, Antelope Canyon, and the Grand Canyon. We did some rock climbing and tons of hiking. Plus, my boyfriend proposed in Zion and is now my fiance!</p>
    <h3>My Favorite Pet Names</h3>
    I do not know any pets with these names, but they seem fun:
    <ul>
        <li>A cat named Puss in Boots</li>
        <li>A dog named Snoop Dogg</li>
        <li>A fish named Nemo</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Favorite Restaurant</h3>
    <p>A favorite restaurant of mine is <a href="https://www.mainstbagelnh.com/" target="_blank">Main Street Bagel and Deli</a>. This is a locally owned restaurant near me that makes delicious bagels. I love to have their garlic bagels with scallion cream cheese on the weekends.</p>
    <h3>My Favorite Food</h3>

    <p>My favorite food is definitely pasta, especially when topped with plenty of cheese. I love to eat it with my father's homemade pasta sauce that I grew up having or my fiance's vodka sauce. Of course, pasta is also great with cheesy sauces, butter, or olive oil. Sometimes I make pasta dishes with feta and veggies mixed in, like olives, tomatoes, zuccini, onions, and summer squash.</p>
